In the following tables,
● “byte” refers to a one-byte integer (suffix b),
● “word” refers to a two-byte integer (suffix w),
● “doubleword” refers to a four-byte integer (suffix l), and
● “quadword” refers to an eight-byte value (suffix q).
Most instructions, like mov, use a suffix to show how large the operands are going to be. For
example, moving a quadword from %rax to %rbx results in the instruction movq %rax, %rbx.
Some instructions, like ret, do not use suffixes because there is no need. Others, such as movs
and movz will use two suffixes, as they convert operands of the type of the first suffix to that of
the second. Thus, assembly to convert the byte in %al to a doubleword in %ebx with
zero-extension would be movzbl %al, %ebx.
In the tables below, instructions have one suffix unless otherwise stated.

Instructions with one suffix
mov S, D Move source to destination 171
push S Push source onto stack 171
pop D Pop top of stack into destination 171
Instructions with two suffixes
mov S, D Move byte to word (sign extended) 171
push S Move byte to word (zero extended) 171
