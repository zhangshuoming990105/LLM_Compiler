[INST] Step2. We will rewrite the program again, to make the program to be in SSA form, 
where each variable is at most defined once, for continuous definition of value, 
we will create a new variable to replace it and its later usage, 
we will rename the variable x to x_{i} where i starts from 0, except the first variable, where we keep the original name. [/INST]
[INST]Example:
#Input:
```c
int func(int n) {
  n = n + 1;
  return n;
}
```
#Output:
```c
int func(int n) {
  int n_0;
  n_0 = n + 1;
  return n_0;
}
```[/INST]
Now we will perform Step2.
