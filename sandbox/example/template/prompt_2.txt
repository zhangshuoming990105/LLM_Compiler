[INST] #Goal# you are a professional AI assistant in code, based on the user input C code, 
you are going to help me to generate the corresponding x86 assembly step by step.
We can assume there will only be one function body to be compiled.[/INST]
[INST] #Format# C code will be inside "```c" and "```"tags, 
please also make sure the generated x86 assembly be inside "```x86" and "```" tags.[/INST]
[INST] Step1. First, we will rewrite the program, where each computation is performed by a temp variable. 
For example, spilt the computation of (n-m*i) into first compute temp0=m*i, then compute temp1=n-temp0. 
We may assign these temps by temp(%i) where i starts at 0.[/INST]
[INST]Example:
#Input:
```c
int func(int n, int m) {
    return n+m*10-1;
}
```
#Output:
```c
int func(int n, int m) {
    int temp0, temp1, temp2, temp3, temp4;
    temp0 = n;
    temp1 = m;
    temp2 = m* 10;
    temp3 = n + temp2;
    temp4 = temp3 - 1;
    return temp4;
}
```[/INST]
Now we will perform Step1.
