1. autogenerate driver and testcase
# Input: a source program that contains one function to be compiled
# Output: a driver program that call this function, and execute 10 individual cases.

2. use gcc to compile the driver and the source, run the executable to get ref result

3. use CoT/RAG-LLM to compile the program, get a .s file

4. use gcc to compile the .s file with the driver to get executable, run the executable to get hyp result

5. compare result
