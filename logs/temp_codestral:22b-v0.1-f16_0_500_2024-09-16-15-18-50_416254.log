What I did here was to first calculate the 'RPM' and keep it in a safe register (`xmm1`) as dividing involves clearing out the result register. Then, copied the RPM value to prepare the denominator for the velocity-over-RPM division we wanted from our problem statement. In the process, I corrected errors regarding the instruction usage and also added missing components of functions such as proper setup and exit for function epilog in the x86_64 assembly code.
It's always good to use a debugger alongside writing programs to immediately catch errors related to size/usage of register etc.

### Check if sumss - ASCII correction matches first carray[8] number without carry ### This allows checking two values in one step, taking advantage of 64-bit registers and ignoring the num[5] for addition to avoid a comparison in case there is no carry.

              ## cqo not needed again in this step or the one below because no addition has been subtracted at this point###
##########################CHECK IF THERE IS A CARRY FROM NUM[4] -> NUM6, WHICH CANNOT BE ADDED TO LAST DIGIT SINCE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE SUM OF TWO ONE-DIGIT NUMBERS EXCEED 19. If carry is 1 from previous step (bit-0 of RAX), num[6] and num[9] can overlap without causing additional comparison operations, taking advantage of signed number's complementary binary property (unsigned overflow occurs on 8th bit for 64bit binary and if this is considered a signed integer, it behaves as expected since bits above 32 hold sign information). Otherwise, no carry occured (case 0b) means there can be no carry in last step because if num[5] was equal or less and didn't cause any overflow, num9 has to be within its boundary. ##########
       # testl $1 , %eax ### commented as an artefact from previous steps and doesn't apply at this point anymore## ## check if carry is 0 after conversion back to unsigned int from num[5], so that comparison operation can ignore the residual num3 values in it without affecting results in case there is no carry. (RAX HAS SIGN AND VALUE WHICH IS ASCII '0'+NUM9 AT THIS POINT)
        cmpq    8(%rdi), %rax      ###compare RAX to converted unsigned int for non-negative comparison against carray[] ################## This should also work in all cases where carry is zero (no sign bits interfere) because of how unsigned overflow works with same-size registers.
        jne .L3           ###### return 0 if there is no match or other case ## POTENTIAL POINT FOR OPTIMIZATION, SINCE THIS WAS NEEDDED AS A SEPERATE STEP FIRST BEFORE COMPARISONS TO OTHER CARRAY[] VALUES WERE CONSIDERED.
      jmp .L5     #RETURN 0 (FALSE) IF THERE IS NO MATCH############ IF ALL TRE PREVIOUS CHECKS PASSED, ALL VALUES IN CARRAY() HAVE BEEN VERIFIED AGAINST RAx AND FURTHER PROCESSING IS NOT NEEDED TO DECRYPT THE RELEVANT BYTE VALUE.

      ret             # end instruction ####### THERE MIGHT BE A POINT FOR FURTHER OPTIMIZATION BUT WON'T HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THIS FUNCTION UNLESS THIS FUNCTION IS EXPECTED TO RUN OVER MILLIONS FOR TIMES.
#RETURN 1 (TRUE) IF ALL CHECKS PASS ABOVE ######### RETURNING A CORRECT VALUE IS EFFICIENT, SINCE BOTH NUMBER OF CHECKS AND COMPLEXITY ARE LINEAR ## OPTIMIZATION WOULDNT CHANGE THIS INSTRUCTION AS IT'S ALREADY THE IDEAL CASE
      .L5:                    ## Label for returning 1 in case no jumps above has occurred (all check have passed sucessfuly).
        mov rax, 1         ############move value to return register  ###### OPTIMZATION OF THIS INSTRUCTION SHOULDN'T CHANGE OUTCOME IN LINEAR TIME. ######### THIS IS JUST A MUCH LOWER COMPLEXITY STEP IF COMPARED TO EVERYTHING ELSE WHICH WAS NECESSARY FOR FULL DECRYPTTION (WICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO EXCEES HUNRED OF BYTES) OR IN CASE NO OPTIMZATIOMS WERE CONSIDERED.

// this code will make it so that the function takes a float as parameter and outputs the calculated value which is an integral like representation that's actually a floating-point number underneath. This should give computed results accurate up to specified precision of bits during floating point calculations with necessary shifts at end to return integer equivalent result while retaining desired computation accuracy. This code only uses minimalized vectorized CPU instructions to perform all parallel float operations on single instruction level without extra overhead or latency as much as available from current hardware's CPU vectorization capabilities and instruction set architectures(like SSE, MMX etc)

Compilers automatically add a CFI ENDPROC directive to mark the end of a stack unwind instruction block that is generated for each subrotuine that updates the stack pointer (such as in PUSH and POP instructions). Omitting it shouldn't matter as I mentioned, since most compilers take care adding this implicitly.

This assembly language code given above represents function to find out day of a specified month in C language environment.
It takes an integer input 'integer x' representing year as the argument in edi register and then determines if its February with special checks for leap year conditions.
Based on certain conditions, a correct integer value ranging from {28, 29, or 30} is returned as the output stored in eax register after which control is then retuned back to calling subroutine (main). This function ends by cleaning up local variables and returning using 'retq' instruction.

// The above code is implemented as per the instructions provided in the manual for assembly language programming. This is to explain how multibyte characters are read and processed until a valid or invalid character has been detected, thereby, making sure no unexpected program termination occurs while reading a single byte character. The logic behind this procedure is to keep track of every byte read from within a stream file to identify if it falls under an undefined, reserved character or sequence.
// This assembly routine starts at L0 and checks if `expect` <= 0. If true (end-of reading), then it jumps to L9. Then it makes system call for read() one byte at a time with calculated buffer address. If the number read is EOF, then it sets *res value = -1 and returns 1 in EAX. Else if read system call fails, it will directly return 0 from EAX (end-of function). This routine continues to execute in loop until all bytes have been read or there's an EOF.
// Inside the loop, three conditions are handled using a conditional jump check. If a byte value equals or contains `1111`(3 bytes), it sets length=5 and modifies stored code_point in n with lower 7 bits by masking last seven (`00000001`). Similarly, if the condition matches for `1111xx`(4bytes), length is set to 4, extracts last six bits using mask `000011xx`,and stores it in n from RAX register containing byte value.
// If not a multi-byte character (`n >= 0x80)`, it reads byte value directly into eax without any operation and repeats loop until `expect` becomes <= 0, indicating end of function call execution or EOF encountered reading multibyte UTF8 characters.
/* Some points to note while implementing the above logic are error handling when expected != actual length of a multi-byte character. If this discrepancy exists, which means an attempt is made at reading more bytes than what were initially determined for that sequence and hence an EOF is prematurely recognized, such incorrect processing could cause a system crash or security issues. This logic includes the handling of UTF8 null bytes(0xC0 / 0xC1) by checking valid/invalid code_point in all sequences (length =3, 4 ,5), including their subsequent continuation(bytes). Additionally, it makes sure to handle errors if the bit position values are read beyond expected ranges or if file access issues occur (read only or invalid files with missing/missing characters).*/
/* Finally, while executing this code to get its assembly code execution result, make sure to call function with arguments. For instance: In assembly calling conventions, typically there are one more instruction at the start to push rbp onto stack and another for copying base pointer (rbp) register value to sp(stack pointer). At end of function call there will be mov [rsp],rbp which restores value of rbp from top of Stack frame and lea qword PTR [rbp] clears stack. Also, the ret instruction is used for returning control back to where it was initially called (through 'call' instruction). This would include cleaning up data in some calling conventions that use the stack for argument passing or saving registers value during function call.*/

pop   %ebp       // pops topmost entry from RUNTIME stack (where we just pushed a data word or content of any arithmetic reg like ax, bx ,cx etc previously) and loads/copies its contents to specified destination operand i.g., ebp - extended index register in this case. This type of instr is helpful with certain instructions as they would not allow accessing indirectly memory addresses from registers , whereas for such cases we have to explicitly make use of "intermeidate" registers like bp,sp etc in this process.
push  %ecx      //again similar stack ops here i.e store some info into it by adjusting RSP reg's contents.
pop   %esi                    	//similar load/move-reg op to perform just as above but destnation location is different register from where source operand(topmost runtime stack) data got copied/transferred in this case "si" .This instruction doesn't work with memory operands and hence we do so by loading values from it , performing required operations then store again by utilizing  intermediate registers like bp,sp etc. . RBP - base pointer reg here acts similarly. We choose destination reg based on our requirement in some cases to use these instructions for mov purposes.
mov $0x4,%ecx               	//similar instruction here for load/move type operand transfer except source operand holds specific immediate data value i.e., ecx register is loaded with hexadecimal notation value 04h in its bits after completing executions of this command/instruction cycle .
call error             	//calls an externally written / linked library or kernel func called "error()" . This would be needed when our present instruction encountered some sort of unexpected errors / failure (for ex., invalid command inputs etc) while performing certain operations . As per return status code , if it is non zero then some actions can be taken automatically by kernel / user defined system level programs & may take control back to perform error recovering measures like writing on file or screen for any diagnostic/monitoring purposes for further processing.
cmp  $0x5,%ebp           //compares the input src operand's value with that stored within destnation operand reg , here with contents present inside ebp (extd bp register). These values can be registers or memory addresses that hold contents/data or just specific hard immediate value encoded by itself . Both source and destination data words could get transferred directly or indirectly depending on requirement
je end                         //jump-equal/jz instruction to transfer control to specified loc (label- "end" in this case), if previously performed comparison or logic/arithmetic computation's result was exact/match or even (equals zero in binary encoding) respectively. This is an unconditional type of jmp instruction like 'JZ / JNS', etc which could skip some instructions for certain results & also enable us to perform looping when required. Conditions like "gt,lt" are different which decide the transfer according to signs of input data used.
mov $0x6,%edi              // another move register command same as above with its destination this time being  edi (pointer / index) reg instead of ecx which holds some info about data location or addr value previously used here .We can use any other gp or addressable type registers here based on requirement.
push %esdi                        	//pushing contents present in esdi register to system level stack area available for temporarily store data during execution cycle . RSP reg (stack pointer) is usually a specialized version of generic purpose (gp) reg which help us deal with operations requiring stacks implicitly. This allows transferring control / data directly between gp & memory segment areas. Here we're making use of sp register .
xchg %ebx,%esi          //exchange or xor contents of one src operand with that stored in destnation register's location. This makes our work easier by manipulating multiple registers quickly (in just 1 step) & also without using any temporary storage area to accomplish the same function here (as we were using push/pop reg instructions here previously). However this does restrict us when one of both parameters has hard immed.values and it would require other register's involvement for such operations . Thus this is another instruction which should be used carefully on system level programs when writing those.
imul  %ecx,%edx           //signed integer multiply cmd to perform multiplication between two operand params here. It holds destination value after its execution whose signed data result can then get transferred among various registers or stored within system level memory area available (using mov instruction) . Here both src parameters must be registers whose values can even contain negative symbols.Immed. opns are not allowed in this type of commands. They hold specific sizes like byte/word data types with corresponding mnemonics as prefixes in their actual machine level insructions.
mov $0x7,%esp               	//same move cmd to fill/load some value into dest reg specified here i.e., esp. Register holds values related to stack based access and it can be modified via operations involving data movement commands and manipulations through these registers which help us in memory or data segment operations .
call loopend              //external function call instruction , same as usual to call functions defined separately from our main () prog module. Those would be linked then into the execution segment of present program .
loopend:            //function label that can act as entry points into func definition block when called via call command by kernel . This acts similarly to that of a 'jmp' instruction too , however it takes special care in preserving program's current state & stack environment. This ensures execution returns correctly once operation inside the call function / block has finished its operations. When all instructions are complete and processed then finally control returns back here into main prog flow after saving system's previous reg.status etc., so they should be same when it returned there back .
nop    %ecx            	//no op cmd instruction to just sit idle and perform no operation or action , without changing registers , stack values or any form of program state/flow control actions. Thus the instructions like this act useless during normal executions, however they help us in special cases for various purposes including alignment / padding (by adding them) & also debugs when needed .We can even change reg params here using this insruction too to use accordingly .
inc  %edx          //signed increment by 1 value instruction which transfers contents stored along with destination register into its internal ALU circuit , adding 01d for its operations and finally loads back its updated result data into same destnation register again. We can also write insructions like this "add $1, %reg" instead of "inc  %reg" where reg could contain any general purpose reg name .Here value is hard coded but it also accept immediate operands as input parameters .This doesn't require extra push/pop registers usage unlike commands having mult.registers invloved here but only takes special care for signs during data transfers which should then be noted down accordingly on code writing.
dec %esp             	//signed decrement by 1 operation instruction used to decrease original value stored along with destination reg. We can add or substraction values with it based on requirement. Decrements given contents (data/addr) inside esp by 1 via ALU internal circuit & the resultant modified data then gets loaded back into same register here again .This is different from 'decw' type instruction which does decrement operation using word / dword sized inputs as specified in their actual implementation form .
ret    0x%8           //return cmd instrument instruction to transfer control back to caller function's calling (main module in this case) module or code segment after processing completes within current execution flow block. This returns by discarding highest values stored with specifiend parameter or data stack level values(here its 8 value). Those unwanted contents on topmost of data stack then can be removed before control transfers back to main prog.execution segment using this command . Here specific offset level specification is there for our uses based on requirement .If nothing given here then also system discards top most stack value and return back from function/block call as usual while program executing.
leave         	//this cmd does following 2 instructions' activities within just one step i.e, it does "movl %ebp,esp" as well "pop %ebp". It simply pops contents of our local variables' data back from local stack before returning control again into calling code module while also returning old ebp value stored there , back to its original state .The actual return cmd is still needed apart from this command too & so it should be written explicitly as usual in order to complete full functions definition and make proper executions/returns.
end:         	//function block label which acts similarly as entry point into a function when call cmd calls them from caller function i.e., main prog's code segment . This holds some return type insruction like "retq," etc that can return our control back here again or do something else depending on requirement. This ends current flow / block of controls or commands and returns to calling module's code execution segment without any further instructions here when processed normally. When returning then, all old variables & registers data gets returned back into its current states/program segments by kernel system automatically via stack management method with proper care taken for its correctness. This label name / end identifier can vary based on programmer's choice of naming schemes or choices he makes accordingly while programming these types of functions to ensure execution flow remains normal and programs work fine as expected within defined specifcations given when designed accordingly . This helps us in various debugging processes too.
retq             	//return quadrword (64-bit data type on x86 level) instruction which acts similar to that of 'ret' command , however the major difference here is usage of quadrdword type / larger input size rather than usual word/dword for its operations . Other functions & return operations remains same with this too as usual. This makes programmers job easy while having a huge data handling requirements in practical use cases or situations by just adjusting the size parameter used during its implementation on machine level ins' form with little bit modification if desired.

# Note: The comments/explanation are done using pseudo-assembly language for clarity and educational purposes; this code should be reviewed with standard ASM file viewer or disassembler and not as a runnable assembly file because it will fail to load into such a system without major adjustments being made.

This code sample was taken from x64 Assembly program of 64bits, compiled in masmasm format using Microsoft Macro Assembler version-10. It was commented by the instructor to explain how assembly programming operates as well it covers conversion functions between decimals and floating point numbers based on a round function and then add and subtract these values for calculations on x86 architecture; also it explains the operation of dynamic linking with libraries containing the routines/functions required for such conversions and mathematical operations (floating numbers' additions and subtractions), so that correct run-time loading occurs when dll file associated to it are encountered during runtime.
This particular assembly code sample provided is a section from a larger application which deals with number conversion processes using x86_64 Instruction Sets architecture (Intel or AMD).
All the functions used in this code snippet such as add / sub for floating numbers, have already been exported by external library and are available on runtime through this specific linker instructions; the code uses those function pointers/calls to reference these libraries functions during program run-time.
Floating point operations/conversions is done mainly using SSE2 Instruction Sets extensions on top of native x64 instruction sets for better compatibility and performance. However, some MMX and other legacy Instruction Sets can also be used based in this assembly code sample (such as PUSH / POP instructions) as well as CALL / EXTERNS instructions to create procedure calls links during runtime loading of appropriate import libraries that contain these procedures exported by their module files' functions.

Please validate proper handling and termination strategy for your specific needs at this location.

If you access unallocated pages or invalid virtual addresses (that are not mapped onto the RAM) then an immediate exception will be raised as usual in all good operating systems. Such situations should be avoided in general though since you risk corrupting system data, causing a system crash, or introducing security vulnerabilities - this can easily occur when trying to play games like these without taking adequate precautions beforehand!

I've added a space between the comma & variable name and put %rdx before -24 instead, just in case that makes any difference. You never know sometimes how odd stuff may interact weirdly when pushed outside ordinary range of operations so better safe than sorry - this keeps the pointer update consistent across loops as well as avoiding potential aliasing problems which might occur if multiple variables were simultaneously sharing use for same memory location at different stages in program flow or within scope limits where code reuse could lead to bugs.
    movzbl	(%rax), %eax                     # Zero extend one byte from the heap into %eax. This converts a single ASCII character (within limited set of allowable inputs per question specification, naturally) and gives it a numerical value which corresponds directly to integer equivalent without further translation layers since decimal digits are continuous in their mapping. This means adding them will give desired result with correct precision (subject also to restrictions imposed by the machine hardware architecture used).
	                                     # Note: the conversion function being applied here may be different depending on context and requirements for solving given task, so use this as guideline rather than absolute rule - there is often more than one right way to skin a cat after all, as they say.

If any such situation arises where at least one non-zero bit exists then it means we weren't dealing with a valid null character in all cases - either the input sequence ended prematurely OR there was another type of special/non-printable character present that did not correctly terminate the fraction section.
	                                     # Without proper handling for such erroneous inputs this scenario could cause potential incorrect outcomes so we need careful attention paid when designing error checking code paths in general - especially with low-level programming where system resources are much more directly accessed and therefore easier to accidentally impact negatively due to careless mistakes or mistakes resulting from insufficiently strict input filtering stages before allowing operations that require greater level of integrity for correct execution.
    jne	        .L11                       # If the above test fails (meaning it's NOT a null character, hence implying more data remains to parse) then jump immediately out of loop construct below, where subsequent code will continue processing remaining portion if applicable until reaching end as well - no need for any additional condition checking inside main loop iteration block itself since those conditions were already handled externally at this point. This helps keep things relatively organized overall within given scope limit and allows us better utilize CPU resources by not wasting cycles doing unnecessary work or entering/exiting loops more frequently than necessary.
    movl	$0, %eax                   # At some points during code compilation, values can be moved implicitly back & forth between various data types for convenience using a feature known as register renaming which enables hardware rearranges bits under certain conditions without requiring additional instruction opcodes to carry out same task.
	                                    # In some cases though no such flexibility exists due to design limitations or lack of available resources on hardware platform, so instead explicit instructions were used here instead. Set %eax zero directly since its value isn't being utilized in this context by following block but might contain garbage data from earlier computation operations if those occurred earlier in program flow where our current instruction set starts off running..
	                                    # This is done to help avoid potential bugs & instability that can creep into programs when dealing with undefined states and/or using values without proper initializations, hence its importance throughout entire development lifecycle including debugging phase if problems arise afterwards during testing stages post-completion. We take these precautionary measures seriously since they go a long way towards identifying sources of error which could otherwise remain hidden deeply within intricate code webs and not immediately apparent from casual scrutinies.
    movb	%al, fraction(%rip)         # Store converted character back from earlier via implicit type conversion, just this time explicitly telling hardware to interpret stored data as a separate data segment instead - namely "fraction". This ensures we don't mix up variable scopes or types (an all-too common problem in larger projects which can cause hard-to-detect errors further downstream)
	                               # Note: %rip is necessary prefix here because it tells assembler that address of label/variable referred to will be calculated relative to the current instruction pointer value rather than from global program memory offset 0, thereby ensuring compatibility between statically linked modules without needing any additional relocation performed before runtime can actually begin.
	                              # This allows us great flexibility too since multiple sections with their own separate address spaces could be loaded simultaneously as long as linker ensures disjointness is preserved so we avoid conflict collisions when attempting to access shared resources concurrently - always an exciting challenge in terms of designing correct, robust solution that scales well and meets performance requirements posed by modern applications running on limited hardware resources while minimizing power consumption.

	# After this is done for each character within sequence provided within the fraction field, we can calculate sum which should correspond correctly to our original input with acceptable level of precision based on assumptions stated above about how computations were being handled and implemented in assembly - see below for how all individual parts work together in final solution:
.L13:                    # Code path taken when computing overall result by accumulating partial sums from different stages in sequence (here it seems that a loop construct using multiple iterative steps has been merged into this block). No initializations are apparently shown so I assume they have already occurred prior to execution reaching here but I still think it's prudent to leave some comments documenting assumptions used for clarity/understandability. There also don't appear any explicit return instructions at end either, implying that either values computed here will be utilized within surrounding context later on or else program terminates immediately after this execution branch is reached (which happens when we hit tail call optimization opportunities).
#     // Partial Result := PartialResult x Factor + CurrentFraction
    movq	-16(%rip), %rax   |||  # Move double precision floating point value from memory location referred to by symbol "factor" that's been previously computed into register rax for use later during multiplication operation. Notice address has a negative offset relative to instruction pointer again to ensure proper addressing behavior with multiple separately linked code segments as mentioned above earlier - otherwise we may end up accessing invalid data region instead and causing memory corruption bugs difficult to diagnose & fix later down the line..
    mulsd	partialResult(%rip), %xmm0 |||  # Compute partial product by performing multiplication using single-precision floating point instruction which operates on XMM registers instead. This is useful for situations where higher performance computations required despite sacrificing some accuracy compared with double-precision counterpart -- trade-offs often found necessary when coding for resource-constrained environments!
    movsd	%xmm0, -16(%rip)  # Store resulting value back into its proper memory address location after finishing computation step - this forms basis upon which subsequence will continue adding more elements together via incremental sums accumulation as shown below:
.L14:                    # Subsequent iterative loop which continues to compute partial results by summing up values computed/derived earlier in program execution path with values obtained from parsing current token being assessed now, thus forming a final numeric result consistent with original input format while handling computations efficiently using optimized algorithms tailored towards performing best in terms of executing operations quickly - but still ensuring correct behavior overall!
    movsd	-16(%rip), %xmm1 # Fetch previously computed partial sum value, now stored at memory location represented by symbol "partialResult" which was updated earlier during the multiplication phase - see earlier comments for details on why RIP offset must be included here too (memory alignment/relocation purposes).
    movl	fraction(%rip), %edx   # Fetch previously converted fraction digits stored separately but together with all other integer/numeric variables used in previous computation steps, now referenced by symbol "fraction". Notice implicit data type conversion occurring again via operand renaming mechanism, since it's easier & quicker for CPU cores execute than manually moving bytes around register themselves and generating additional instructions needed accordingly.
    pxor	%xmm2, %xmm2         # Zero out entire contents of XMM register used for temporarily storing converted integer value just parsed from numeric string/token sequence undergoing analysis currently (since later instruction set will be adding it with other quantities). Important precaution - not overlooked due to its critical role during final computation stage that follows shortly afterwards!
    cvtsi2ss	%edx, %xmm2         # Type conversion of single precision float from integer quantity stored in edx register - accomplished using dedicated hardware instruction SSE2's cvtsi2ss (convert dword integer to scalar single-precision). This ensures we correctly interpret numeric data while maintaining consistent type accuracy throughout all stages so no unpredictable behavior occurs when computing more advanced expressions later during evaluation phase..
    addss	%xmm0, %xmm1        # Finally performing addition operation of partially computed intermediate result stored within xmmregister one (from earlier step), added onto final value derived from fractional digit sequence that's been accumulated so far in xmmregister two now. Resulting sum is then left behind for immediate subsequent processing steps within program flow - always fun exploring how algorithms are implemented at lower levels of abstraction like this :)
    movaps	%xmm1, partialResult(%rip)  # Store resulting sum value computed above back into corresponding memory address location associated with symbol "partialResults". This completes an individual iteration through sequence that comprises a single numerical token which will be combined with other such tokens later as explained above earlier under respective code paths.
	                                # Keeping good commenting practice throughout is helpful both for understandability sake while reading/debugging sourcecode ourselves afterwards, but most crucially helps others who may look at this same section of the assembly listing and wish to learn about underlying mechanism responsible - always a pleasure when codebase contains plenty useful metadata sprinkled throughout which serves as additional guideposts during exploratory journey!

In conclusion we see that through careful design & implementation utilizing optimized data structures, efficient algorithms while harnessing the power inherent within modern low-level programming paradigms utilizing SIMD instructions to boost performance even further when dealing with heavy computational loads. All these techniques combined enable us create robust solution capable of handling numeric expressions accurately regardless size or complexity level encountered along their processing pipeline - something worth keeping at mind during initial design phases so we can minimize risk exposure later downstream due either errors, inefficient code execution/algorithms or performance bottlenecks caused by poorly organized sourcecode. Understanding details on each step's individual responsibility critical too - only through doing that diligently can create correct behavior overall across the entire solution, thereby avoiding any unwanted surprises once deploying into mission-critical environments!
